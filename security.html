        In downtown areas of the city, locking ones bike is essential to not allowing ones bike to get stolen. Unfortunately, there is no way to make ones bike theft proof. Even the fanciest solutions can be cut eventually. Further, the police seem not to care (see below video) about bike theft and rarely do anything. Still, bike security is often about being the less vulnerable then other bikes, so good practice is important.

      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <p>
        First, it is important to have a good lock. Something that is hard to cut or pick will prove to be an effective deterrent as it will increase the opportunity cost of stealing <em>your</em> bike. While these can get expensive, finding a used Kryptonite is well worth your while.

        Second, many bikes have quick release tires. If you plan on locking your bike about the city, it is wise to remove or lock these quick release systems. It is often impossible or inconvenient to lock both tires and the frame of a bike so this change will save you from being hasty and loosing a wheel.

        Finally, it is important to know where to lock your bike. It is best to do so in a high visibility area and ensure that there are no signs prohibiting bikes. Further, stay away from scaffolding and short posts as these can often be circumvented.
